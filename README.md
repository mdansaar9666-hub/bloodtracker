Bloodtracker is a real-time, AI-prioritized emergency blood coordination platform that:
Connects patients to nearest verified donors
Integrates blood bank stock tracking
Uses smart urgency scoring
Prevents fake or inactive donors
Optimizes response time
⚙️ Core Features
1️⃣ Smart Donor Registration
Blood group
Location (live GPS)
Last donation date (90-day rule enforcement)
Availability toggle
Verification via hospital upload or medical proof
This avoids fake registrations.
2️⃣ Emergency Request System
When a patient requests blood:
Select blood group
Choose urgency level:
Critical (0–2 hrs)
High (2–6 hrs)
Scheduled surgery
System instantly:
Filters eligible donors
Checks last donation date
Ranks by distance
Sends push notifications
3️⃣ Radius-Based Live Matching
Instead of showing 100 random donors:
Auto-search within 5 km → 10 km → 25 km
Displays estimated arrival time
Shows donor response probability score
That’s practical innovation.
4️⃣ Rare Blood Priority Network
Special tracking for:
O negative
AB negative
Rare types
Verified rare donors are tagged and alerted first.
5️⃣ Blood Bank Dashboard
Hospitals can:
Update live stock
Set low-stock alerts
View demand analytics
When stock < threshold → system alerts nearby donors automatically.
Now this is scalable.
🧠 Innovation Angle (This Wins Hackathons)
AI Urgency Scoring Algorithm
Score =
(Urgency Level × Weight)
(Rarity Factor)
(Distance Factor)
(Donor Availability Score)
This creates intelligent alert sequencing.
Most existing platforms don’t do this.
🛡️ Safety & Privacy
Donor phone number hidden
In-app secure communication
OTP verification
Medical upload validation
Donation history tracking
🌍 Social Impact
Reduces emergency search time
Helps rural areas with limited blood banks
Creates community-driven rapid response network
Potential integration with government health systems
💻 Technical Architecture (For Judges)
